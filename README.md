# LaTeX to EPUB Converter

A simple and efficient Python script that converts LaTeX `.tex` documents into EPUB format, leveraging the power of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). This tool supports seamless conversion of academic papers, e-books, and any LaTeX document with full bibliography and citation management using BibTeX. It's perfect for authors, researchers, and anyone looking to publish LaTeX-based content as an EPUB.

LaTeX is a popular typesetting system used for creating documents with complex mathematical formulas, academic papers, and technical documentation. However, when it comes to distributing LaTeX content digitally, converting it into a universally readable format like EPUB can be challenging. This script streamlines the process and ensures that citations and bibliographies are handled properly during conversion.

## Features

- üìö **Full support for BibTeX citations and bibliography** using `--citeproc`.
- üöÄ Easy to use: Just define input/output files and run the script.
- üñ• Works for academic papers, research articles, e-books, and any LaTeX-based documents.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Simple Python script with minimal dependencies.
